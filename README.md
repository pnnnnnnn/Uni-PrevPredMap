## Introduction
This repository is an official implementation of Uni-PrevPredMap.

## Overview
![overview](assets/overview_v2.png "overview")
This project introduces a unified prior-informed framework that systematically integrates two synergistic information sources: previous predictions and simulated outdated HD maps. The framework introduces two core innovations: a tile-indexed 3D vectorized global map processor enabling efficient refreshment, storage, and retrieval of 3D vectorized priors; a tri-mode operational optimization paradigm ensuring consistency across non-prior, temporal-prior, and temporal-map-fusion-prior scenarios while mitigating reliance on idealized map fidelity assumptions. 

## Visualization
![qa](assets/qa_v3.png "qa")
This image displays prediction comparison of Uni-PrevPredMap in three modes: Uni-PrevPredMap<sup>1</sup>, Uni-PrevPredMap<sup>2</sup>, and Uni-PrevPredMap<sup>3</sup> denote non-prior, temporal-prior and temporal-map-fusion-prior modes, respectively. Corresponding priors are illustrated to demonstrate their influence. Green, orange and blue lines represent road boundaries, lane dividers and pedestrian crossings, respectively.

## Models

#### nuScenes dataset

plz stay tuned

#### ArgoVerse2 dataset

plz stay tuned
